workflow of each node in the system
- Solution: 
    - Add a new service into the service discovery of NDN RIOT system to let each device be able to
reply it’s status to the controller (Android Phone)
   - Android phone periodically query the status from each device
   - Android phone visualize the status in its GUI
   - Requirement: Android Phone, Android App development skills


## 2. Broadcast and ad-hoc wireless faces in NFD

Project Lead: Md Ashiqur Rahman, The University of Arizona

**Motivation and Problem Statement**

- Task
  - NDN self-learning is initially defined for point-to-point
links only. •An important scenario for NDN self-learning in NFD is on
wireless channels, such as ad-hoc WiFi networks among
Android devices. •Thus, the protocol definition shall be extended to
support broadcast and ad hoc wireless faces.

- Benefit to NDN:
  - Current NFD does not support broadcast and ad hoc wireless faces which would be helpful for working in ad-hoc networks. 

- Expected Outcome:
  - To have support for broadcast and wireless ad-hoc faces in NFD. 
- Tools:
  - NFD, ndn-cxx, C++
  
## 3. Interest Buffering

**Motivation and Problem Statement**

Project Lead: Tianxiang Li, UCLA

- Task

  - When transmitting Interests, what if there is no available faces
  - If no face available, Interest is buffered in PIT
  - Detect when a face is up, trigger Interest to be sent out on that face
  - Face should report to strategy its own status, whether it’s up or down
  - Face signaling has not been supported yet in NFD
- Tools
  - NFD, ndn-cxx, C++

  - A simple visualization that can be further developed into a working 3D visualization prototype.

## 7. NDN sign-on protocol implementation over BLE
  
Project Leads:  Yanbiao Li, Zhiyi Zhang

**Motivation and problem statement**
  - As a typical use-case of sign-on, a constrained device obtains the local trust anchor and an
anchor-signed certificate from the controller (i..e, an android-phone). But some constrained
device can only communicate with the phone via Bluetooth Low Energy.
- Contribution to NDN-IoT
  - Enable to deploy NDN-IoT package on more boards
- Tasks
  - Implement NDN sign-on protocol (detail doc will be provided to the participants later) with an
android phone and a nRF58240 board

802.15.4 at the same time!
- Goal: to let the existing service discovery and access control protocol function
on the new boards
 - Requirement: NRF52840 board, C coding skills

## 10. Certificate Support in esp8266ndn Library
  
Project Leads:   Junxiao Shi

**Motivation and problem statement**

- esp8266ndn: library for developing NDN app on ESP8266/ESP32 MCU
  - esp8266ndn is used in building sensing deployments at Memphis & NIST.
- esp8266ndn supports HMAC and EC signing and verification, but application
must provide uncompressed kit bits.
- This project: add NDN Certificate v2 decoder and encoder.
  - It paves the way of implementing trust schema, ndncert-client, and secure device onboarding in the
future.
- Requirement: must have ESP8266 or ESP32 hardware.


## 11. Tiny Forwarder with esp8266ndn Library

Project Leads:   Junxiao Shi

**Motivation and problem statement**

- esp8266ndn: library for developing NDN app on ESP8266/ESP32 MCU
  - esp8266ndn is used in building sensing deployments at Memphis & NIST.
  - In both systems, sensor nodes are one hop away from NFD.
- This project: create a tiny forwarder on ESP8266/ESP32.
  - We explore a specific design: per-face Bloom filters as PIT, instead of name-based PIT.
  - Sacrifice preciseness of PIT name matching and InterestLifetime, in exchange for lower memory
requirement.
- If successful:
  - Building sensing deployments do not need to depend on infrastructure network.
  - Same design can be ported to NDN-RIOT.
- Requirement: must have ESP8266 or ESP32 hardware.

## 12. HMAC and Merkle-Hash-Tree Signatures in ndn-cxx

Project Leads:   Junxiao Shi

**Motivation and problem statement**

- SignatureHmacWithSha256: hash-based signature with provenance.
  - defined in NDN Packet Format, implemented in CCL, but missing in ndn-cxx.
- SHA-256-Merkle-Hash-Tree: aggregated signing, individually verifiable.
  - defined in CCNxx 0 packet format, but we should explore this algorithm. 
  - When producing many Data packets, the producer only needs to perform one RSA/ECDSA
signing, while each Data packet is individually verifiable.
- This project: add HMAC and Merkle hash tree signing/verification.
  - HMAC implementation is intended to be mergeable to the codebase.
- Requirement: understand crypto; can write C++14.

## 13. NDN File System without FUSE

Project Leads:   Junxiao Shi

**Motivation and problem statement**

- NDNFS: an “NDN-friendly file system”. https://github.com/remap/ndnfs-port
  - Copy files to FUSE <= cannot use existing folder of files.
  - NDNFS daemon segments the file and stores signatures <= several open bugs.
  - Data are then served over the network.
- This project: explore a different design.
  - Program works with an existing folder on the filesystem. No FUSE.
  - File segmented and Data signed on the fly upon Interest arrival.
  - It’s as simple as `python3 -m http.server`.
- Requirement: know either ndn-cxx or CCL.

## 14. Modernize ndn-js

Project Leads:   Junxiao Shi

**Motivation and problem statement**

- ndn-js: JavaScript client library for Named Data Networking.
  - NodeJS: works reasonably well.
  - Browser: written in 2013, not kept up with rapidly evolving JavaScript ecosystem.
- This project: make ndn-js integrate well in a modern JavaScript project.
  - Replace Waf build process with a bundler such as Brunch or Webpack.
    - require("ndn-js") should work in web application.
    - Dependencies should come from NPM, not contrib/ folder.
- Provide TypeScript declaration file.
  - This enables type checking of ndn-js APIs in a TypeScript project.
- Add Promise-based APIs as an alternative to callback-based APIs.
- Requirement: can write JavaScript.

## 15. Packet03, Data Synchronization, and More in repo-sql

Project Leads:   Junxiao Shi

**Motivation and problem statement**

- repo-sql: alternate NDN repository implemented backed by a SQL database.
  - https://github.com/3rd-ndn-hackathon/repo-sql
- This project: a refresh of repo-sql.
  - NDN Packet Format 0.3: Selectors are gone.
    - Redesign database schema and query procedure.
    - Reimplement QueryProcessor without selectors.
- Add some commands: let's compete with repo-ng.
  - TCP bulk insertion.
  - Data insertion command.
- Data synchronization using PSync: repo-ng does not have this, but we have.
  - Start with one-way mirroring: secondary instance mirrors a subset of Data from primary instance.
- Requirement: can write C++14 and know ndn-cxx.

## 16. Refactor encoding and decoding in NDN-RIOT and make it more usable to developers

Project Leads:   Zhiyi Zhang, Yanbiao Li, Bo Chen, NDN-IOT

**Motivation and problem statement**

- Existing NDN-RIOT:
  - NDN packet format 0.2 
  - Some APIs are missing, e.g., name decoding
  - Too many dynamic memory allocation, which is highly not recommended by RIOT team
  - Not very developer-friendly: developers need to manually work on encoding and decoding process
in some cases
- Goal: Make NDN-RIOT a better library to use
- A work in progress
  - We already re-implemented the basic block 0.3 encoding/decoding APIs, name APIs, Interest APIs
  - Refactor other modules (Data, Certificate, etc.)
- Requirement: C coding skills

## 17. Schematized Trust in NDN-RIOT

Project Leads:   Zhiyi Zhang, Yanbiao Li, Bo Chen, NDN-IOT

**Motivation and problem statement**

- With NDN-RIOT, we are able to do basic signature signing and verification.
However, to achieve trust and more fine-grained authentication, schematized
trust is required in IoT scenarios.
- Goal: A simplified version of trust schema in NDN-RIOT
  - Use pre-defined rules instead of manually configured rules as the default trust policy to minimize
the human interactions
    - E.g., some pre-defined rules: Controller Only, Same First n Prefix Only, Signature Only
  - Make schematized trust configuration a service accessible to system controller only: controller can
configure the trust policies of a device
    - E.g., Add one or a set of prefixes/devices into the authorized list to a service provided by the device
- Requirement: C coding skills
