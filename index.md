The NDN Team is organizing our 7th NDN Hackathon on Oct 20 and 21. We are soliciting Hackathon project proposals that advance the state of NDN.  Participants will have approximately **12 hours** to work on the projects.

We encourage projects that:

 - Directly address NDN research needs,
 - Create new NDN tools or modify existing tools,
 - Create or improve documentation and how-to guides.
